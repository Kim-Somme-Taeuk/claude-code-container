 * produces no effect and is therefore never removed, which is the single most important
 * property here: creation must not delete a device root it did not create.
 *
 * WHEN each is recorded is part of the contract, not an executor detail. `directory-created`
 * and `file-created` are recorded the moment the host object comes into existence -- not when
 * the step that makes it succeeds. A base-image copy that creates its destination and then
 * fails partway (hash mismatch, length mismatch, plain I/O) has already put a partial
 * multi-gigabyte VHDX in the device root, and recording only on success would leave it there
 * forever. The legacy rollback deleted the disk path unconditionally, so recording late would
 * make this plan strictly weaker than the script it replaces on exactly that sequence.
 * `vm-created` has no such window: native either returns a VM or it does not.
