 * Orders the steps that bring one VM into existence.
 *
 * The order is the behaviour, not an implementation detail, and three parts of it are load
 * bearing:
 *
 * - the disk is copied before `New-VM`, because `New-VM` attaches it and cannot attach a file
 *   that is not there yet;
 * - for a bootstrap guest, `New-VM` is given the *bootstrap* switch, because the adapter it
 *   creates for free is the one that must carry DHCP; the device adapter is added after, so
 *   that the two always land in the same relative order and their names are predictable;
 * - firmware is configured last, because the first boot device it names is the disk, and the
 *   disk is only attached to a VM once that VM exists.
 *
 * Pure: the same request always produces the same steps, and nothing here touches a host.

 * can remove it -- creation must never delete a directory it found rather than made. The
 * legacy script kept the same fact in `$DeviceRootExisted` and consulted it in its rollback;
 * this is that variable, made explicit and made plural.
 *
 * Undone in reverse, because the later a change was made the more it depends on the earlier
 * ones: the VM must go before the disk it has attached, and the disk before the directory that
 * holds it. Applied to what the legacy script recorded, reverse order reproduces its rollback
 * sequence exactly -- remove the VM, delete the disk, then the directories.
 *
 * Every entry is best-effort and independent. A caller that stops at the first failure leaves
 * the residue the remaining entries exist to clear, and is not running this plan.
