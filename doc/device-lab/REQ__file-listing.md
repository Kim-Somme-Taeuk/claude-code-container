# Device file listing

`list_files` lists one directory on the device identified by `deviceId`. Callers
provide `path`, without a backend selector. Results contain `entries` with each
entry's `name`, `type` (`file`, `directory`, `symlink`, or `other`) and optional
file `size` in bytes. Empty directories return an empty array. Hidden entries are
included. Listing never recursively traverses entries or reads file contents.

The default entry limit is 100; callers can request 1–500. A conservative output
byte limit also applies before transport. `truncated:true` means either limit was
reached, so a partial listing must never be mistaken for a complete directory.
Missing directories, permissions, failed commands and malformed responses remain
errors. Paths are command data, including whitespace, quotes and Unicode.

Android, Linux/QEMU, macOS, Windows Sandbox and Hyper-V reuse their existing
owned-device command transports. Required incarnation and physical lease checks
remain. Listing does not start devices, provision software, or install anything.
An iOS Simulator call requires `appId`; `path` is relative to that app container
and must not escape it through traversal or symlinks. Physical iOS/iPadOS currently has no
Device Lab listing adapter and reports that implementation limitation explicitly.
This does not mean the platform forbids all file access: apps enabling File
Sharing can expose their Documents files through supported host transports. A display ID is not a file
storage target.

Immediate POSIX glob enumeration can expand a large directory before the bounded
output loop. Existing command deadlines remain; entry/output limits do not promise
constant-time traversal. Real Windows/macOS/iOS behavior requires native host
validation in addition to command and adapter fixture tests.

Verification covers empty/hidden directories, filename quoting and newlines,
symlinks, missing paths, entry/byte limits, malformed transport results, ownership,
incarnation propagation, app-container containment and source/bundled MCP discovery.
